I am an (evolutionary) ecologist broadly interested in population and community dynamics, with an emphasis
on the role of dispersal and movement ecology for higher levels of biological organization. 

My background is in conservation biology and field studies (e.g. my Diploma thesis on dispersal and 
population dynamics of a endangered checkerspot butterfly in Portugal), but for my PhD with 
[Nicolas Schtickzelle](http://www.uclouvain.be/en-81772.html) at Universit√© catholique de Louvain (Belgium),
I have shifted to microbial model systems of protists to address fundamental questions in ecology and evolutionary biology.

I am now a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Owen Petchey, pursuing my research with the
microbial model system, but focussing more on the community level. Firstly, I study the
effects and predictability of temperature increase on community structure and composition, and secondly the consequences 
of intraspecific trait variation on community dynamics.

Besides my scientific questions, I actively develop digital image and video-based techniques to
automatically quantify individuals and their traits in the microbial model systems we use in our lab.

Please get in touch if you are interested in my research and potential collaboration!
