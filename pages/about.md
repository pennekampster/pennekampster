I am an (evolutionary) ecologist interested in the influence of dispersal and movement 
ecology of animals on population and community dynamics. 

I use microbial model systems to address these questions using new image and video based
techniques to quantify trait and abundance dynamics with high temporal resolution.

Please get in touch if you are interested in my research!
