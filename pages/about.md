I am an (evolutionary) ecologist interested in population and community dynamics, with an emphasis
on dispersal and movement ecology. Whereas my background is in conservation biology and field studies 
(e.g. my Diploma thesis on dispersal and population dynamics of a endangered checkerspot butterfly in Portugal), 
I have shifted during my PhD with Nicolas Schtickzelle at Universit√© catholique de Louvain, Belgium 
to use microbial model systems of ciliates to address fundamental questions in ecology and evolutionary biology.

I am now a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Owen Petchey, pursuing my research with the
microbial  model system, but focussing more on the community level. Firstly, I study the
effects and predictability of temperature increase on community structure and composition, and secondly the consequences 
of intraspecific trait variation on community dynamics.

Besides my scientific questions, I am actively developing digital image and video-based techniques to
automatically quantify the individuals and their traits in the microbial model systems, we use in our lab.

Please get in touch if you are interested in my research!
